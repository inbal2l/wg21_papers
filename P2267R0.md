# Introduction

The discussion on the necessity of policies for the standard library has been going on for many years. 

There have been a few papers addressing different aspects of it: [@P0684R2], [@P2148R0], [@LibraryDesignGuidelines] and others.

Notice that the [@requirements] section which appears in the beginning of the standard library section in the working draft does not conflict with policies as the policies are focused on Library API. 

This paper aims to survey the pros and cons of such an approach, and set up a process for setting and modifying a policy for the C++ standard library.

# Motivation and Scope

The standard library is a resource shared by the C++ community. As such, it contains parts which should support functionality from different domains.

At the same time, consistency is very important, as it allows users to build some expectations while using different parts of the library.

In the following paper we will try to define what a policy is, what's the scope in which it applies and how to build a consensus for it.

## What is a policy

A "policy", as discussed in this document, is any technical rule or technical guideline, which, as a general rule, should be followed by authors of proposals of `future` utilities for the C++ standard library. 

A "utility" can be a container, an algorithm, an output / logging facility (std::format), a function, a header, or any other logical unit proposed to the standard library as a paper.
A policy can be applied to existing utilities, but that will require an explicit paper. 

In this document we only discuss the process and meaning, and do not propose any specific policies, but examples of such may be: Mark all constructors or only single parameter constructors as `explicit`, use hidden friends for ADL detection, etc. Full list of examples of possible policies (Which are NOT proposed in this paper) are given in [Appendix A] Section below. 

A policy has to be described clearly and provide coherent guideline for authors. The policy description can leave no room for interpretation, so that even if a utility does not follow a certain policy, we will have a clear understanding of what is the policy which is violated and how.

## Rationale for setting a policy

We see both pros and cons in taking this approach, the following sections we will describe them.

### Pros for setting policies for the standard library

We believe the following should be considered as upsides:

#### Policies create uniformity in usersâ€™ expectations from the behaviour of different parts of the standard library

The current state of the library is inconsistent. As of now, users have to be familiar with the details of a utility in order to use it. 

Here are a few statistics for existing policy "candidates":

| Feature | First option | Second option | Third option | Forth option |
| :------ | :----------: | :-----------: | :----------: | :----------: |
| constexpr CTORs |  Yes (15) | No (3)  |  - |  -  |
| `explicit` CTORs |  |   |   |    |
| Hidden friends |  |   |   |   |
| `noexcept` marked APIs | exception throwing only () | return value only utilities | utilities support both approaches | utilities with other error handling approaches |
| Error handling in containers | exception throwing only (0) | return value only (1) | utilities support both (6) | utilities with other error handling approaches (1) |

We see a lot of value in making the standard library more coherent, from a teachability perspective, as well as to increase the consistency of code design.


#### Policies save time for both authors and the committee
With policies, authors can know what is expected in the paper before reaching LEWG. This can save time of repeating the same guidance to different authors.
Moreover, in the current process, it is not uncommon for authors of a proposal to get opposite and conflicting guidelines between different versions of a proposal, even without new information coming up. The reason being that the room may contain a different audience in each meeting.
Having to re-iterate previously proposed directions can be a source of frustration and can be very time consuming for the authors, without adding to the quality of the proposal. 
We understand that in some cases going back from a change may be needed, and that this is part of the process, but we believe policies will be able to minimize this effect, as, at least for some parts of the proposal authors will know what they are expected to do.

#### Policies need to be created from a shared knowledge base
As of now, discussions on "policy" level topics can happen in different times and rooms (not just in LEWG, but also in SGs), as they can be "spontaneously sparked" by a specific topic in the paper discussed. This has two main disadvantages:
1. Not all the stake-holders can be in the room, as the discussion is not always announced in advance.
2. It is not possible to be in all the rooms at once, the knowledge and guidelines tend to be sparse, and to be passed by second and third-hand. 

Setting "formal" discussions in which a specific policy will be discussed helps in collecting the input of all the committee members and stake-holders, and can help with minimizing the amount of things left for interpretation of the attendees, and misunderstandings that can result from such interpretations.

#### Policies are making the standardization process friendly for newcomers
In the current state, newcomers who would like to make a proposal to the standard library have no way of knowing "common guidelines" apart from going over all of the minutes from previous discussions (and even then, not everything is documented).
This is a very bad way to preserve knowledge. Apart from being time consuming, learning from the minutes can lead to wrong outcomes, as minutes can be misinterpreted. 
We believe that there's a lot of value in making sure newcomers can benefit from the committee's "shared knowledge base". This will save time both for the authors, and for the committee.

### Cons for setting policies for the standard library

#### Policies may "push aside" domains which are in a minority representation in the committee
Some technical guidelines are not fit for all the users of C++. We believe that, unless we take an approach of "lowest common denominator" some parts of the standard can and should support these domains.
This is true not just for policy discussions, but as a general property of the current process, as "counting votes" does.
To avoid the majority vote running over the minority vote, we propose that a paper will be able to bypass a policy, by providing a rationale for it. We describe the details in the proposal section, but we believe this is an important part of the process. 

#### Policies may enforce wrong technical solution for some utilities proposed for the standard library
A major concern may be that "Policies" block specific technical solutions from being proposed into the standard library. This is a valid concern, and we address it by requiring a significant majority to set a policy, and by allowing bypassing a policy (with rationale).


# Impact On the Standard
This proposal and the policies which will result of it are not proposed for the C++ standard (IS).

However, the policies will apply on the utilities which will be inserted into the standard.

# Proposal

## Requirements from a policy paper

A policy paper, as being very segnificant to the committee process, must contain the following:

1. A rationale.
1. A survey of the prior art of the topic, as appears in the standard.
1. A survey of the status quo for this topic, in the wider C++ community. Preferably, this should contain the impact on different domains and industries.
1. A clear and concise definition of the policy proposed.


## The process of setting a policy

As a policy being a significant part of the standard library, we need to make sure all interested parties have a saying.

To address the first section under cons, policies should be able to get bypassed. This should be done by explicitly stating the policy bypassed (and the specific way in which it's being bypassed, if needed) and rationale in the paper. 
We believe that even if bypassed, there's still value in policy, for setting the common understanding, and saving time as described above. 

We propose the following process for setting a policy:

1. LEWG will announce a policy topic for discussion at least one month prior to the mailing list, to allow all the stake-holders to publish a paper for the upcoming mailing list, and either attend or send representatives.
1. All the papers for a policy have to appear in the Mailing List before the meeting.
1. Passing a policy paper, require a significant majority of the room.
1. The policy vote require approval by an electronic poll.

We propose to set a new standing document (SD-9), in which we'll collect guidelines for policies. Each policy voted into the document will be set using the process described above.

## The process of modifying a policy

The process of modifying a policy

1. In order to schedule a meeting for re-discussing a policy, there should be new information.
1. The rest of the process will follow the steps in section "The process of setting a policy".

## The process of removing a policy

During a discussion on modifying a policy, there could be the case that the need for removing a policy will come up. 


This should be done in the same process used for adding a policy.

## Excluding a paper from applying a specific policy

To address the concerns brought up in "[Cons for setting policies for the standard library]", we propose that a paper will be able to avoid applying a policy, as long as it addes **detailed technical ratioanl and justifications**. 

Prior art in the field discussed can also help with providing reasoning, but it's on the authors on the paper to explain why the policy can't be successfully applied on the utility, once proposed into the standard library.

# Appendix A

## Policies Examples (NOT proposed in this document)

Examples of topics which **MAY** be discussed as policies in LEWG (we DO NOT suggest any of them in this paper):

1. Mark all constructors or only single parameter constructors as `explicit`
1. Use hidden friends for ADL detection
1. Use a wide contract or a narrow contract for setting the rules of `noexcept`
1. Limit new utilities using concepts instead of type traits
1. Small headers vs. large headers
1. Member vs free functions
1. Mandatory `[[nodiscard]]` on relevant functions

Notice that the [@requirements] section which appears in the beginning of the standard library section in the working draft does not conflict with policies as the policies are focused on Library API. 

They are also not discussed in [@N4944] or [@N4938].
