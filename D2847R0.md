# Introduction

This paper aims to evaluate the syntax proposed in: "[@P1240R2]: Scalable Reflection in C++", which is, to our best knowledge, the most recent paper discussed in SG7, and which got the most consensus to move on. During our review, we also considered [@P2320R0] and [@P0425R0].

We examined the syntax proposed for several use cases. Among others, we were relying  on the use cases introduced in section "[Targeted use cases](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3814.html#Targeted-use-cases)" from the paper: "[@N3814]: Call for Compile-Time Reflection Proposals".


# Motivation and Scope

Reflection is a powerful tool that, once implemented, will provide extended abilities to developers.
However, we also want to identify the scope of such a tool. To achieve that, we've created the following examples as a thought experiment. Our goal is to identify both the limits and the capabilities of the currently proposed syntax.

We've examined the following use-cases:

  - From [@N3814]:
    - Generation of common functions
    - Type transformations
    - Compile-time context information
    - Enumeration of other entities
  - We've also considered:
    - Object-Relational Mapping
    - Mocking for unit testing
    - Python Binding (and the wider scope problem of ABI-level integration across languages)
    - Serialization
    - Customizable Functions    

# Use Cases Analysis

We've applied the syntax in the suggested proposal to common use-cases. Each section contains an example of syntax usage, and some contain limitations which we found important to highlight.

## “Hello world” meta attributes

```cpp
#include <experimental/meta>
#include <iostream>

namespace meta = std::experimental::meta;

struct hello {
  void world();
};

int main() {
  constexpr meta::info hw = ^hello::world;
  std::cout << meta::name_of(meta::remove_pointer(meta::this_ref_type_of(hw)))
            << ' ' << meta::name_of(hw) << '\n';
}
```

The following use-cases are taken (or extrapulated) from [@N3814].

## Generation of common functions

There are several use-cases that use reflection in the standard today even if they are not called that way. Namely the default constructors (default, copy, move), destructor, and assignments (copy, move). 

But the list can be extended to further functionalities, for example:
  - Comparison operators.
  - Getting the hash value of an object.
  - Print operator.
  - Serialisation (for example: JSON for REST calls).

We believe this use case is only partially covered by the current syntax. Examples below describe some of the limitations ("serialization" topic will be covered separately).

```cpp
#include <experimental/meta>
#include <iostream>

namespace meta = std::experimental::meta;

enum Department {
    SALES = 1,
    DEVELOP = 2,
    MARKETING = 3
};

struct Employee {
    std::string name;
    uint32_t empNumber;
    Department dep;
};

void PrintEmp()
{
    constexpr auto e_members = members_of(^Employee, is_nonstatic_data_member);
    template for (constexpr auto m : e_members) {
        std::cout << std::meta::name_of(m) << ",";
    }
}
```

Capabilities as described are limited for textual analytics, we can't achieve macro-like behavior.
Moreover, free functions can be created more easily than member functions, which may discourage developers from applying object-oriented programming idioms when using reflection.

This can be done:

```cpp
struct Employee {
    std::string name;
    uint32_t empNumber;
    Department dep;
};

void PrintEmp()
{
    constexpr auto e_members = members_of(^Employee, is_nonstatic_data_member);
    template for (constexpr auto m : e_members) {
        std::cout << std::meta::name_of(m) << ",";
    }
}
```

But this is not:

```cpp
#include <experimental/meta>
#include <iostream>

namespace meta = std::experimental::meta;

enum Department {
    SALES = 1,
    DEVELOP = 2,
    MARKETING = 3
};

struct Employee {
    std::string name;
    uint32_t empNumber;
    Department dep;
};

template<typename Obj>
struct EncapsulatedObj {
                                                      // Use `for` in the body of a class
    constexpr auto e_members = members_of(^Employee, is_nonstatic_data_member);
    template for (constexpr auto m : e_members) {
        template<typename T>
        T get[: std::meta::name_of(m) :]()            // Can't extract expressions for textual purposes
    }
}
```

### Limitations emerge from the example above

  - Capabilities needed for "injection":
    - Syntax which breaches the scope of the C++ metaprogramming, such as reflecting in the scope of a struct (needed for "injection")
    - Can't use text manipulation to define multiple functions by the same "shape" (macros-like behaviour is limited)
    - In general, free function syntax partially support some of the capabilities, but member function additions are limited

## Type transformations

We want to be able to transform (or wrap) one type into another. One example can be adding strings as description for reflection purposes.
For example:

```cpp
#include <experimental/meta>
#include <iostream>

namespace meta = std::experimental::meta;

// Type To be reflected
struct MemberType {
    std::string str;
};

struct Type {
    int a;
    int b;
    double c;
    MemberType member;
};

// Reflection helpers
template<typename T>
std::vector<std::string> getMembers() {
    std::vector<std::string> membersList;
    template for (constexpr auto e : meta::members_of(^T)) {
        membersList.push_back(std::string(meta::name_of(e)));
    }
    return membersList;
}

// example usage
int main() {
    auto membersList = getMembers<Type>();
}

```

This example shows we need to have constexpr vector type which will allow "collecting" information during reflaction stage.

## Compile-time context information

TBD

## Enumeration of other entities

TBD

## Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)

```cpp
#include <experimental/meta>

namespace meta = std::experimental::meta;

consteval const char* to_sql(meta::info type) {
  if (type == ^int) {
    return "INTEGER";
  }
  if (type == ^float) {
    return "FLOAT";
  }
  return "UNKNOWN";
}

consteval const char* generate_column_sql(meta::info data_member) {
  return __concatenate(meta::name_of(data_member), " ", to_sql(meta::type_of(data_member)));
}

consteval const char* generate_table_sql(meta::info clazz) {
  const char *table_name = meta::name_of(clazz);

  const char *table_sql = __concatenate("CREATE TABLE ", table_name, "(");
  bool first_seen = false;
  for (meta::info member : meta::data_member_range(clazz)) {
    if (first_seen)
      table_sql = __concatenate(table_sql, ", ");

    table_sql = __concatenate(table_sql, generate_column_sql(member));
    first_seen = true;
  }
  return __concatenate(table_sql, ");");
}

enum class cardinal_direction { NORTH, EAST, SOUTH, WEST };

class player {
  float pos_x;
  float pos_y;
  float pos_z;
  int level;

  cardinal_direction calculate_cardinal_direction() const;
};

constexpr auto table_sql = generate_table_sql(^player);
constexpr auto __dummy = __reflect_print(table_sql);
```

## Mocking for unit testing

When working with unit tests, mock objects - for example a mock logger instead of the real logger in the system. This allows breaking the dependencies between components and testing each separately. Those mock objects typically require considerable boilerplate code to generate - a struct\\class needs to inherit from the struct or class that is used to communicate between components and all the virtual functions need to be overridden with a pretty standard code. This could easily be done using reflection.

## Python Binding

The need to allow ABI-level binding (for example - by Python) comes up in a lot of use cases. Reflection is a natural choice for creating the facilities to allow it (inspecting the existing code, creating functionality for the binding on top of it). We need to address this use case (and the wider scope of using reflection for adding abilities in binary interface) when considering our solutions.

Examples of such use-cases can be found in the blog post: "[C++ Reflection for python binding](https://accu.org/journals/overload/27/152/standish_2682/)" by Russell Standish and in the talk: "[Programming for Every Language, Everywhere, All at Once](https://youtu.be/43Tmqn-sFsk)" given by Shachar Langbeheim at Core C++ 2022.

Similarly to the above blog post we have made an attempt to use existing python binding libraries, specifically pybind11, in conjunction with value based reflection (P2320) to assess the practical advantages and challenges of the latter. As the basis of our research we have used a trivial implementation of a crossing engine with order types and lock3 implementation of P2320.

More information on this use case can be found in: [@P2911R0]

## Serialization

TBD

## Customizable Functions

TBD

## Better DO_ON_INIT

Logging is currently the main one, but more may come up down the road. This utility itself allows running a custom piece of code at global init time, be that to facilitate logging or for any other appropriate use case.

Example of such code:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <type_traits>

template<size_t ln, auto fn>
void consteval do_on_init() 
{
    static_assert(std::is_invocable_v<decltype(fn)>);
    consteval->namespace(::) fragment namespace 
    { 
        static auto unqualid("dummy", ln) = []{fn(); return 0;}(); 
    };
}



using void_fn_t = void(*)();

#define DO_ON_INIT(...) \
	{ \
	constexpr void_fn_t fn_on_init = []() { __VA_ARGS__; }; \
	do_on_init<__LINE__, fn_on_init>(); \
	}

void f() 
{
    DO_ON_INIT(printf("injected\n"));
    DO_ON_INIT(printf("injected again\n"));
}

int main() { return 0; }
```

The lock3 clang fork can easily inject a fragment into the global namespace from an uninvoked context (See https://cppx.godbolt.org/z/hbxKvsv7a). However, doing that more than once attempts to inject a same-named dummy variable which leads to a name clash. Solving this issue without having to resort to any macro would require having a constexpr way of producing unique names - which would be used to either produce a unique dummy var name, or perhaps to place the dummy var and the lambda in a uniquely named namespace

This immediately brings to mind source_location, which unfortunately appears to be unsupported by this clang fork (haven’t checked current versions). Neither source_location nor experimental/source_location headers are present (at least on godbolt pr1240r2 trunk).

Another language addition which might solve this issue would be static variables in constexpr/consteval functions. This would allow similar logic to what can be currently achieved with COUNTER macros (obviously only in macros).

Alternatively, the combination of the following features might open up a different avenue:

- Being able to implicitly create a block fragment out of a sequence (possibly initializer_list) of statements.
- Having a way to inject a block fragment into any function from any possibly unrelated scope.

Having these two features would allow implicitly converting a sequence of statements into a block fragment (without needing the help of a variadic macro) and then injecting it into a single function which we would create in the global scope. The global function would be unique and thus we would just pick a name for it. The injected block fragments would become normal sequences of code in that function and would not require any automatic generation of unique names, thus bypassing this issue altogether.

Yet another way of bypassing the unique naming issue would be provided by P2169, which proposes having multiple unnamed objects in the same scope denoted by a _ placeholder, as long as no attempt is made to access them (which indeed we don’t need to).

### Limitations emerging from the example above

  - Source_location, usable at compile-time.
  - A way of passing an unnamed stateless lambda as either regular or template argument to a consteval function, all in a single statement.
- Block fragments being implicitly created from a sequence of statements.
- Being able to inject block fragments into any function.
- Local statics in constexpr/consteval functions.
- P2169 (multiple unnamed objects denoted by _ placeholder)
