# Introduction

This paper discuss to type-based vs. value-based reflection.
The current direction proposes pure value-based reflection (which we will refer to as “Mono type” during this paper). We would like to “bake” some (limited amount) of types into the information, we believe this will help us create better error messages, as well as a better model.

Please note these are not the same suggestions addressed in [@P1240R2], [@P0425R0], [@P0633R0] and [@P2560R0]. We do not suggest keeping the type information throughout the process of template instantiation. We would like, however, to have some type system as part of the final model produced by the process.

During this paper, we’ve considered the Mono type vs. Multi type approach.
Interpreter design to allow type based.

# Motivation and Scope

There are certain tradeoffs between using a multi-type versus a mono-type representation of reflection results. The purpose of this paper is to enumerate some of the benefits of each representation in order to better evaluate the tradeoffs.

# Multi-type Reflection

As mentioned, the current suggested form of reflection is mono-type. The following suction suggests a survey of the possiblities and alternatives.

## Benefits of Mono-type

The benefits of mono-type are mostly related to ease of implementation. Benefits to the developer are indirect in that a simpler implementation is more likely to be more performant and available for use sooner.

- Easier to define. There is no need to name the different sorts of reflection results, and consequently no need to identify which categories are worthy of being named.

- Less rigid. Categorization of a reflection is implicit in the functions that successfully operate on them. Categories can easily change and remain backwards compatible as long as the existing functions that operate on them behave the same. 

- Faster to compile. Unless users build their own typed API on top of it, the simpler monotype API should be faster to compile.


## Benefits of Multi-type

The benefits of multi-type accrue primarily to the developer, at the expense of more work for the implementation.

- Documentation. Code is easier to understand when including types in function signatures and variable declarations.

- Type validation. Calling functions with an argument of the wrong type would generate an immediate error rather than an error deeper in the call stack where the argument is used. Enforcing type correctness can also catch errors earlier in development, even before a function is invoked.

- Overloading. Using different C++ types when reflecting different entity types allows the use of overloading functions. Overloads make code organisation easier and can be easily used as a customization point to support new types.

- Coding assistance. IDEs will have an easier time recommending useful completions if variable types are known.

### Possible Representations of Multi-type

Different ways of representing multi-type reflection results have their own tradeoffs regarding flexibility, extensibility, and ease of implementation.

- Class hierarchy. Requires new language features such as parameter constraints in [@P1733R0] or constexpr function parameters in [@P1045R1]. Alternatively, the compiler could be aware of the reflection types and construct the correct type when a reflection operation is performed. The correct design of the hierarchy is not obvious. Single inheritance may not be sufficient to capture all interesting relationships between objects. Extending a hierarchy to incorporate new object types is difficult, especially for the user who cannot modify the existing types being built upon.

- New built-in types. If the compiler has special knowledge of the types involved, then hierarchical organisation of types is not required and correct conversions can be supported without adding any new language features. Relationships between the types are more flexible because they are implicit. Extending this type of system is not possible for the user.

- Value concepts. If the concepts feature were to be applied to constexpr values in addition to types, then we would gain the ability to define conversions between variables represented as concepts based on user defined constraints. Those constraints wouldn't need to be strictly hierarchical and they could be easily extended by the user.


## Closed-set Type-based Reflection

During the discussion, we've brought up the possibility of type-based reflection for a closed set of items. This will mean only preserving the types for the final stage of reflection (discarding the mid-process ones) and providing a closed-set of types, with a limited set of properties which can be reflected (user-defined types are considered a single type).
